# How to build a site

Building a simple website starts with a clear goal: what do you want visitors to do or see?

First, sketch a basic layout: a header with your logo, a main content area, and a footer. Keep the structure simple so you can style it later with CSS.

Next, create a single `index.html` file and add the basic HTML skeleton. Link a separate CSS file for styling, and only then start adjusting colors, spacing, and fonts.

Finally, host your site using static hosting like GitHub Pages or any simple web host. Once it’s online, you can iterate: improve content, tweak design, and add more pages as needed.
